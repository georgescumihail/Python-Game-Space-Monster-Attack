# Python Game: Space Monster Attack

A simple game created from scratch by myself, using Python 3.6 and the PyGame library. The goal of the game is to shoot as many invaders as possible, as they become faster and faster as the time goes by. There is a score indicator showing the progress. The soundtrack and "graphics" are original, except for the space photo in the background.
